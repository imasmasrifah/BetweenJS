Robust tween API for JS

Highly inspired from BetweenAS3 (author:yossy(at)be-interactive.org), 
Its API became for me primordial in hi-tech front-end development, 
since one has to become picky and rigourous with Tweens, if one wants a good/fluid result.
- for all known Easings, even Custom easing,
- for relative tweening,
- for Tween manipulation such as Reverse, gotoAndPlay, slice, delay 
- for grouping, parallel, serial
- for nested values to tween -> {x:150, nestedObject:{x:100}}
- suggests a 'yield' pattern workaround
- one unique enterframe
- RequestAnimationFrame implementation in case of native support
- callbacks can work via events
- units handled :
    API syntax is as following:
        BetweenJS.to(target, {'width':130, 'height::%':100}, .25, Expo.easeOut)  ;
    Percents : 'height::%'
    Ems :'fontSize::EM' (case insensitive)
    Pcs :'fontSize::PC' (case insensitive)
    (DEFAULT) Pixels :'fontSize::PX' (case insensitive), or not specified at all ('width':150 will fallback to Pixel units)
    if NO NEED FOR UNITS (opacity, z-index:those type of unitless declarations), use {'opacity::NONE':.4}
- colors handled :
    Hex : 'color::#' or 'color'
    RGB : 'color::rgb'
    (DEFAULT) Hex
    No HSB implementation yet, coming up next
