BetweenJS

Highly inspired from BetweenAS3 (author:yossy(at)be-interactive.org), 
Its API became for me primordial in hi-tech front-end development, 
since one has to become picky and rigourous with Tweens, if one wants a good/fluid result.
- for all known Easings, even Custom easing,
- for relative tweening,
- for Tween manipulation such as Reverse, gotoAndPlay, slice, delay 
- for grouping, parallel, serial
- for nested values to tween -> {x:150, nestedObject:{x:100}}
- implements the 'yield'-type pattern
- one unique enterframe and subscribe/unsubscribe
- for callbacks, can work with or without events

In simple, when creating, don't get frustrated, test it all over to finally choose the best tween for the right purpose.
later, there shall be more to explain, but for more API info right now:

Needs jQuery, NS and Naja to work for now.
